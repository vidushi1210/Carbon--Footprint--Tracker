## Project Overview

This project is a **Carbon Footprint Tracker**. It helps users to:

- Calculate their carbon emissions using various inputs  
- See visual feedback about their environmental impact  
- Track changes over time  
- Encourage users to adopt greener habits

The project has several pages: a home page, a dashboard to view summary, a calculator to enter data, and an impact visualization page.

## Features
Here are the main features:
- **Home Page**: welcome / landing page.  
- **Calculator**: input various data (e.g. electricity usage, travel, etc.) to estimate carbon footprint.  
- **Dashboard**: overview of your results through use of doghnut chart,  with saved or recent calculations.  
- **Impact Visualization**: show the users how there activities impact the environment.  
- Responsive or mobile-friendly styling .

 ## Folder Structure
A summary of the files and directory layout:
├── index.html ← Home / landing page
├── style.css ← styles of home page/landing page
├── calculator.html
├── calculator.js
├── calculator.css
├── IMPACT.html ← Impact visualization page
├── IMPACT.js
├── IMPACT.css
├── Dashboard.html
├── Dashboard.css
└── (other assets, e.g. images, icons, if any)

## How It Work
Here is a basic flow:
1. User opens the app in their browser.  
2. They navigate to the calculator page.  
3. They enter inputs like energy usage, travel distances, etc.  
4. JavaScript code processes these inputs using certain emission factors to compute a carbon footprint.  
5. Results are displayed to the user, in numbers .  
6. The dashboard through the doughnut chart  shows  the data entered in the calculator
7. The Impact Visulization Page tells the user about the user about how much trees,environment is affected we use when we use the entered values in the calculator  

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – structure of pages  
- **CSS** – styling, layout  
- **JavaScript** – logic, calculations, interactivity  
(Used,like Chart.js for graphs)


### Prerequisites
